# NarDialPy

**NarDialPy** is a Python package for building and running **narrative-driven, structured dialog systems** — designed for social robots and conversational agents.

It lets you author complete conversations declaratively in JSON, then drive them from Python using voice, NLU, and LLM services. The package handles session flow, branching logic, topic tracking, personalization, and real-time event interruptions so you can focus on what the robot says and how conversations unfold.

## What is nardial?

The `nardial` package provides the building blocks for authoring and executing multi-turn conversations:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dialog JSON** | Conversations are written as structured JSON files. Each file holds one or more *dialogs*, each containing a sequence of *moves* that the robot performs. |
| **Session Manager** | Loads your dialog JSON, resolves a session agenda, and runs dialogs in order — checking dependencies and tracking state. |
| **ConversationAgent** | The runtime bridge to the hardware: it calls TTS, STT, LLM, and motion services on your chosen device. |
| **Agenda system** | Controls which dialogs run, in what order, and how many times — using composable eligibility rules and typed agenda items that can be configured per session. |
| **Event system** | Asyncio-native event bus with pluggable sources (timers, buttons, webhooks, background LLM) that can interrupt the dialog loop at configurable checkpoints. |

Typical use case:

- A social robot (Pepper, NAO, desktop agent) runs a structured conversation with a child or adult participant.
- The conversation is broken into named dialog blocks (greeting, story, chitchat, goodbye) authored in JSON.
- Python code wires up the device, credentials, and agenda — the JSON drives the actual content and branching.

Additional community demos are in the [SIC Applications repository](https://github.com/Social-AI-VU/sic_applications/tree/main/demos/nardial).

## Prerequisites & Setup

### 1. Python IDE

Recommended: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### 2. Python

- Version: **3.12**
- Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/
- ⚠️ Ensure Python is added to your system `PATH`

### 3. In your project, create and activate your python virtual environment 
```bash
# Windows
cd your_project_folder
python -m venv venv_myproject
venv_myproject\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
cd your_project_folder
python -m venv venv_myproject
source venv_myproject/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install NarDial

Install the core package, then add extras for each service you intend to use:

```bash
pip install nardial
```

| Extra | Enables | Install command |
|---|---|---|
| `google-tts` | Google Cloud Text-to-Speech | `pip install "nardial[google-tts]"` |
| `elevenlabs` | ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech | `pip install "nardial[elevenlabs]"` |
| `dialogflow` | Google Dialogflow NLU | `pip install "nardial[dialogflow]"` |
| `openai` | OpenAI GPT | `pip install "nardial[openai]"` |
| `all` | All of the above | `pip install "nardial[all]"` |
| `dev` | Development tools (pytest) | `pip install "nardial[dev]"` |

For robot devices, install the matching SIC device extra directly:

```bash
pip install "social-interaction-cloud[alphamini]"   # Alphamini
```

Pepper and NAO are included in the base SIC package.


### 5. Configure Credentials
 * Create a `conf` folder at the root of your project.
 * Create a Google cloud project (for Dialogflow and google-tts services) and save the generated keyfile to `conf/google/google_keyfile.json`. Instructions [here](https://socialrobotics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CBSR/pages/2205155343/Getting+a+google+dialogflow+key).
 * Create an OpenAI account, and generate an [API key](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/quickstart) and save it to `conf/openai/.openai_env` with the following content:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your key"
```

> ⚠️ Never commit credential files to version control.

### 6. Start Required Services

Run these in separate terminals before starting any demo:

```bash
# Windows
conf/redis/redis-server.exe conf/redis/redis.conf

# macOS / Linux
redis-server conf/redis/redis.conf
```

```bash
run-dialogflow
run-google-tts
run-gpt
```

---

## Providers & Initialization

NarDialPy is built around a set of provider protocols. Each protocol defines a role (device, TTS, NLU, LLM, vector store) and multiple concrete implementations are available. You pick one implementation per role, instantiate it, and pass everything into `ConversationAgent` or `SessionManager`.

### Available Providers

| Role | Provider | Import path | Requires |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Device** | `DesktopAdapter` | `nardial.providers.device.desktop` | base |
| | `PepperAdapter` | `nardial.providers.device.pepper` | base |
| | `NaoAdapter` | `nardial.providers.device.nao` | base |
| | `AlphaminiAdapter` | `nardial.providers.device.alphamini` | `social-interaction-cloud[alphamini]` |
| **TTS** | `GoogleTTSProvider` | `nardial.providers.tts.google` | `nardial[google-tts]` |
| | `ElevenLabsTTSProvider` | `nardial.providers.tts.elevenlabs` | `nardial[elevenlabs]` |
| | `NaoqiTTSProvider` | `nardial.providers.tts.naoqi` | base (uses device's built-in TTS) |
| | `NullTTSProvider` | `nardial.providers.tts.null` | base (prints to terminal) |
| **NLU** | `DialogflowNLUProvider` | `nardial.providers.nlu.dialogflow` | `nardial[dialogflow]` |
| | `WrittenKeywordNLUProvider` | `nardial.providers.nlu.written_keyword` | base (keyboard input) |
| **LLM** | `OpenAIGPTProvider` | `nardial.providers.llm.openai_gpt` | `nardial[openai]` |
| | `EchoLLMProvider` | `nardial.providers.llm.echo` | base (echoes user input) |
| **Vector store** | `RedisVectorStoreProvider` | `nardial.providers.vector_store.redis_store` | base + running Redis |
| | `NullVectorStoreProvider` | `nardial.providers.vector_store.null` | base |

---

### Minimal setup (no external services)

Good for local development and testing — all I/O goes through the terminal:

```python
import logging
from sic_framework.devices.desktop import Desktop

from nardial.providers.device.desktop import DesktopAdapter
from nardial.providers.tts.null import NullTTSProvider
from nardial.providers.nlu.written_keyword import WrittenKeywordNLUProvider
from nardial.conversation_agent import ConversationAgent

desktop = Desktop()
device = DesktopAdapter(desktop)
device.setup(logger=logging.getLogger())

agent = ConversationAgent(
    device=device,
    tts_provider=NullTTSProvider(),
    nlu_provider=WrittenKeywordNLUProvider(),
)
```

---

### Desktop with cloud services

```python
import json, logging
from sic_framework.devices.desktop import Desktop
from sic_framework.services.dialogflow.dialogflow import DialogflowConf

from nardial.providers.device.desktop import DesktopAdapter
from nardial.providers.tts.google import GoogleTTSProvider, GoogleTTSConf
from nardial.providers.tts.cacher import TTSCacher
from nardial.providers.nlu.dialogflow import DialogflowNLUProvider
from nardial.providers.llm.openai_gpt import OpenAIGPTProvider
from nardial.conversation_agent import ConversationAgent

desktop = Desktop()
device = DesktopAdapter(desktop)
device.setup(logger=logging.getLogger())

tts = GoogleTTSProvider(
    conf=GoogleTTSConf(speaking_rate=0.9, google_tts_voice_name="en-US-Neural2-F"),
    device=device,
    keyfile_path="conf/google/google_keyfile.json",
    tts_cacher=TTSCacher(tts_cache_dir="tts_cache"),
)

nlu = DialogflowNLUProvider(
    conf=DialogflowConf(keyfile_json=json.load(open("conf/google/google_keyfile.json"))),
    mic=desktop.mic,
)

llm = OpenAIGPTProvider(api_key="<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>")

agent = ConversationAgent(
    device=device,
    tts_provider=tts,
    nlu_provider=nlu,
    llm_provider=llm,
)
```

---

### Pepper robot

Swap the device adapter and TTS provider — everything else stays the same:

```python
import logging
from sic_framework.devices import Pepper

from nardial.providers.device.pepper import PepperAdapter
from nardial.providers.tts.naoqi import NaoqiTTSProvider

pepper = Pepper(ip="<PEPPER_IP>")
device = PepperAdapter(pepper)
device.setup(logger=logging.getLogger())

tts = NaoqiTTSProvider(device=device, language="en")
```

Then pass `device` and `tts` to `ConversationAgent` as above.

---

### Using SessionManager

`SessionManager` wraps `ConversationAgent` and adds dialog loading, eligibility checking, and session state. Pass it a `session_agenda` — a list of agenda items that control which dialogs run — and a path to your dialog JSON:

```python
from nardial.session_manager import SessionManager

manager = SessionManager(
    session_agenda=["greeting", "farewell"],   # see Authoring a Session Agenda below
    agent=agent,
    dialog_json_path="dialogs/my_dialogs.json",
    participant_id="user_42",
)
manager.run()
```

`SessionManager` also supports multi-session studies, crash recovery, history resets, and an async API — see [Authoring a Session Agenda](#authoring-a-session-agenda) and [Event System](#event-system).

---

## Authoring a Session Agenda

A session agenda is the ordered list of items passed to `SessionManager` that controls what dialogs run and in what sequence. Each item resolves to zero or one dialog per call. The resolver advances through the list, re-queuing items that are configured to repeat, and skipping items whose pool is exhausted.

Agendas accept a mix of plain strings (backward-compatible — resolved as a direct dialog ID lookup), dicts, and typed Python objects. All three forms work anywhere an agenda list is accepted.

```python
session_agenda = [
    "greeting",                                              # direct dialog ID
    {"type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "main"},           # next step in thread
    {"type": "chitchat_slot"},                              # any eligible chitchat
    {"type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "farewell"},
]
```

---

### Agenda items

#### `dialog_ref` — direct ID lookup

Runs a specific dialog by ID. The dialog's own eligibility policy still applies (e.g. a narrative dialog won't re-run if it's already been completed).

```json
"greeting"
```
```json
{ "type": "dialog_ref", "id": "greeting" }
```

---

#### `narrative_slot` — next step in a thread

Selects the lowest-position eligible `narrative` dialog in the named thread. Enforces sequential ordering automatically — position 2 is not offered until position 1 is completed.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `thread` | string | required | Thread name; must match `"thread"` on the narrative dialogs |
| `bounds` | object | `{"count_min": 1, "count_max": 1}` | How many steps to advance (see [Slot bounds](#slot-bounds)) |

```json
{ "type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "main" }
```

Advance two steps in one agenda item:
```json
{ "type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "main", "bounds": { "count_min": 2, "count_max": 2 } }
```

---

#### `chitchat_slot` — relevance-ranked chitchat

Selects from the pool of eligible `chitchat` dialogs. Candidates are ranked by (1) how many of their declared `dependencies` are already completed, then (2) topic overlap with the user's accumulated interests. A random tiebreak ensures variety across sessions.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bounds` | object | `{"count_min": 1, "count_max": 1}` | How many chitchat dialogs to run |
| `topics_filter` | array of strings | `null` | When set, only dialogs containing at least one of these topics are considered |

```json
{ "type": "chitchat_slot" }
```

Two chitchat dialogs, restricted to animal topics:
```json
{ "type": "chitchat_slot", "topics_filter": ["animals", "pets"], "bounds": { "count_min": 2, "count_max": 2 } }
```

---

#### `functional_slot` — dialog by role

Selects from all eligible `functional` dialogs with the given `functional_type`. Because functional dialogs have no "exclude if already seen" rule, greetings and farewells re-run every session by design.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `functional_type` | string | required | Role: `"greeting"`, `"farewell"`, or any custom value |
| `bounds` | object | `{"count_min": 1, "count_max": 1}` | |

```json
{ "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "greeting" }
```

---

#### `llm_dialog_ref` — LLM dialog by ID

Runs a specific `llm_based` dialog by ID. Optional fields override the dialog's own settings for this run only without modifying the stored definition.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | required | Dialog ID |
| `max_turns` | integer | `null` | Override max turns for this run |
| `duration` | number | `null` | Override time limit (seconds) for this run |

```json
{ "type": "llm_dialog_ref", "id": "free_chat", "max_turns": 3 }
```

---

### Slot bounds

All slot types (not `dialog_ref` or `llm_dialog_ref`) accept a `bounds` object that controls how many times the slot is resolved before the resolver moves on.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `count_min` | integer | `1` | Minimum resolutions required |
| `count_max` | integer or `null` | `1` | Maximum resolutions; `null` means unlimited (runs until the pool is empty) |
| `duration_min` | number | `null` | Keep resolving until at least this many seconds have elapsed |
| `duration_max` | number | `null` | Stop resolving after this many seconds even if `count_min` is not met |

```json
{ "count_min": 1, "count_max": 3 }
```

Run at least one chitchat, up to three, until five minutes have elapsed:
```json
{ "count_min": 1, "count_max": null, "duration_max": 300 }
```

---

### Multi-session plans

For longitudinal studies where each session should follow a different agenda, define a `SessionPlan` in a separate JSON file and pass it to `SessionManager`. The manager automatically selects the right template based on how many sessions the participant has already completed.

`SessionPlan` also supports declaring event sources and handlers directly in the plan file so they activate automatically for every session without extra Python code (see [Declaring sources and handlers in a session plan](#declaring-sources-and-handlers-in-a-session-plan)).

**`study_plan.json`:**
```json
{
  "plan_id": "companion_study",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "session_index": 1,
      "agenda": [
        { "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "greeting" },
        { "type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "intro" },
        { "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "farewell" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "session_index": 2,
      "agenda": [
        { "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "greeting" },
        { "type": "chitchat_slot" },
        { "type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "intro", "bounds": { "count_min": 2, "count_max": 2 } },
        { "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "farewell" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "session_index": 3,
      "agenda": [
        { "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "greeting" },
        { "type": "chitchat_slot", "bounds": { "count_min": 2, "count_max": 2 } },
        { "type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "main" },
        { "type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "farewell" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The last template (here session 3) is reused for any session number beyond 3, so you don't need to define a template for every possible session in an open-ended study.

**Python:**
```python
manager = SessionManager(
    session_agenda=[],                         # overridden by the plan
    agent=agent,
    dialog_json_path="dialogs/my_dialogs.json",
    participant_id="user_42",
    session_plan_path="study_plan.json",
)
manager.run()
```

#### Forcing a specific session

Override the automatic session-number detection with `session_index` — useful for testing a specific template:

```python
manager = SessionManager(
    session_agenda=[],
    agent=agent,
    dialog_json_path="dialogs/my_dialogs.json",
    participant_id="user_42",
    session_plan_path="study_plan.json",
    session_index=2,   # always use template 2, regardless of history
)
```

#### Crash recovery

If a session is interrupted before it completes, pass `resume=True` on the next run. The manager detects the incomplete session and picks up where it left off, skipping dialogs that already ran:

```python
manager = SessionManager(
    session_agenda=[],
    agent=agent,
    dialog_json_path="dialogs/my_dialogs.json",
    participant_id="user_42",
    session_plan_path="study_plan.json",
    resume=True,
)
```

#### Resetting history

To discard session history from a given session onward — for example to re-run a participant from session 2 — use `reset_history_from_session`. A warning is logged before the destructive operation:

```python
manager = SessionManager(
    session_agenda=[],
    agent=agent,
    dialog_json_path="dialogs/my_dialogs.json",
    participant_id="user_42",
    session_plan_path="study_plan.json",
    reset_history_from_session=2,   # discards sessions 2, 3, … and all dialogs run in them
)
```

---

## Event System

NarDialPy includes an asyncio-native event system that lets the robot react to external signals — hardware button presses, timers, web input — without blocking the ongoing conversation. Event sources run as concurrent asyncio tasks alongside the dialog loop, emitting `Event` objects onto a shared `EventBus`. The dialog loop checks the bus at configured checkpoints and either continues, runs a handler dialog, or retries from where it was paused.

`SessionManager.run()` handles all asyncio orchestration internally. You do not need to call `asyncio.run()` yourself.

---

### Interrupt levels

The interrupt level on an event controls at what point the dialog loop will act on it:

| Level | When it fires | Typical use case |
|---|---|---|
| `BETWEEN_DIALOGS` | After the current dialog completes | Session time limit, topic injection between dialogs |
| `BETWEEN_MOVES` | After the current move completes, before the next | Inject a handler mid-session without aborting the current dialog |
| `IMMEDIATE` | Immediately — cancels the active move | Emergency stop, high-priority user action |

---

### Resume policies

When an event fires, the resume policy controls what happens to the interrupted dialog:

| Policy | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DISCARD` | The interrupted dialog is abandoned. The handler dialog runs, then the session continues with the next agenda item. |
| `PAUSE` | The interrupted dialog's position is checkpointed. The handler dialog runs, then the session retries the interrupted dialog from where it left off. |

---

### Built-in event sources

| Source | Import path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TimerSource` | `nardial.events.sources.timer` | Fires once (or on repeat) after a configurable delay |
| `WebhookSource` | `nardial.events.sources.webhook` | Lightweight HTTP server — receives events via HTTP POST from an external UI or web component |
| `BackgroundLLMSource` | `nardial.events.sources.background_llm` | Runs an LLM query concurrently and injects the result as an event when it completes |
| `PepperButtonSource` | `nardial.providers.device.pepper` | Pepper head tactile sensor and three bumper button presses |
| `NaoButtonSource` | `nardial.providers.device.nao` | NAO chest button, head touch zones, and foot bumper presses |
| `AlphaMiniButtonSource` | `nardial.providers.device.alphamini` | Stub — AlphaMini has no physical buttons (exits immediately, emits no events) |

Device sources are registered automatically: each device adapter's `get_event_sources()` method returns its button source(s), and `SessionManager` starts them at session launch. For the desktop adapter, `get_event_sources()` returns an empty list — add sources explicitly via `add_event_source()`.

---

### Wiring up an event source

Use `add_event_source()` and `add_event_handler()` to attach event sources and handler mappings to a session manager:

```python
from nardial.session_manager import SessionManager
from nardial.events.sources.timer import TimerSource
from nardial.events.specs import EventHandlerSpec
from nardial.events.types import InterruptLevel, ResumePolicy

# Fire a "time_limit_reached" event after 5 minutes, between dialogs.
timer = TimerSource(
    event_type="time_limit_reached",
    delay_seconds=300,
    interrupt_level=InterruptLevel.BETWEEN_DIALOGS,
    resume_policy=ResumePolicy.DISCARD,
    handler_dialog_id="timeout_farewell",
    priority=50,
)

manager = SessionManager(
    session_agenda=[
        {"type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "greeting"},
        {"type": "narrative_slot", "thread": "main"},
        {"type": "functional_slot", "functional_type": "farewell"},
    ],
    agent=agent,
    dialog_json_path="dialogs/my_dialogs.json",
    participant_id="user_42",
)
manager.add_event_source(timer)
manager.run()
```

When `"time_limit_reached"` fires, `SessionManager` looks up `"timeout_farewell"` in the dialog registry and runs it immediately, then ends the session.

Multiple sources can be chained:

```python
manager.add_event_source(timer).add_event_source(another_source)
```

---

### Declaring sources and handlers in a session plan

Event sources and handlers can also be declared directly in a `SessionPlan` JSON file so they activate automatically without extra Python code:

```json
{
  "plan_id": "companion_study",
  "sessions": [...],
  "event_handlers": [
    {
      "event_type": "time_limit_reached",
      "handler_dialog_id": "timeout_farewell",
      "interrupt_level": "BETWEEN_DIALOGS",
      "resume_policy": "DISCARD",
      "priority": 50
    }
  ],
  "event_sources": [
    {
      "type": "timer",
      "event_type": "time_limit_reached",
      "delay_seconds": 300,
      "interrupt_level": "BETWEEN_DIALOGS",
      "resume_policy": "DISCARD",
      "handler_dialog_id": "timeout_farewell",
      "priority": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported `type` values for `event_sources`: `"timer"`, `"webhook"`.

---

## Defining Dialogs in JSON

All conversation content lives in a JSON file (or directory of JSON files). The file is a JSON array of dialog objects.

### Dialog Structure

Every dialog has the following shared fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | ✅ | Unique identifier referenced in `session_agenda` and `dependencies` |
| `type` | string | ✅ | Dialog type: `"functional"`, `"chitchat"`, `"narrative"`, or `"llm_based"` |
| `moves` | array | ✅ | Ordered list of move objects the robot will perform |
| `dependencies` | array of strings | | Dialog IDs that must have been completed before this dialog may run |
| `variable_dependencies` | array | | Variables that must exist in the user model before this dialog may run |

Example: 
```json
{
  "id": "greeting",
  "type": "functional",
  "functional_type": "greeting",
  "moves": [
    { "type": "say", "text": "Hi! I am your robot assistant." }
  ]
}
```

---

### Dialog Types

#### 1.`functional`

Utility dialogs for session management — greetings, farewells, and structural transitions.

| Extra field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `functional_type` | string | ✅ | `"greeting"` or `"farewell"` |

```json
{
  "id": "welcome",
  "type": "functional",
  "functional_type": "greeting",
  "moves": [
    { "type": "say", "text": "Hello! What is your name?" },
    {
      "type": "ask_open",
      "text": "Please tell me your name.",
      "set_variable": "first_name",
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### 2. `chitchat`

Short conversational exchanges on everyday topics. Chitchat dialogs are selected by the agenda's `chitchat_slot` based on topic relevance and how many of their declared dependencies have already been completed.

| Extra field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `topics` | array of strings | | Keywords used for relevance matching against the user's accumulated interests |

```json
{
  "id": "favorite_animal",
  "type": "chitchat",
  "topics": ["animals", "pets"],
  "moves": [
    {
      "type": "ask_open",
      "text": "What is your favorite animal?",
      "set_variable": "favorite_animal",
      "add_interest_from_answer": true
    },
    { "type": "say", "text": "I like %favorite_animal% too!" }
  ]
}
```

---

#### 3. `narrative`

Story-based dialogs that belong to a named thread and must be delivered in a specific order. Use `position` to sequence them and `dependencies` to enforce ordering.

| Extra field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `thread` | string | ✅ | Story thread name (e.g. `"dreams"`) — groups related narrative dialogs |
| `position` | integer | ✅ | Order within the thread (1, 2, 3, …) |

```json
{
  "id": "dream_intro",
  "type": "narrative",
  "thread": "dreams",

#### 4. `llm_based`

A fully LLM-driven dialog where the robot and user engage in a free-form multi-turn exchange guided by a system prompt. No `moves` array is needed — the LLM generates all responses.

| Extra field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | string | ✅ | System prompt guiding the LLM's behavior |
| `max_turns` | integer | | Maximum back-and-forth turns (default: 5) |
| `speak_first` | boolean | | If `true` (default), the robot speaks first; if `false`, it listens first |
| `duration` | number | | Time limit in seconds for the whole exchange |
| `quit_phrases` | array of strings | | User utterances that end the exchange early |
| `quit_signal` | string | | Token the LLM can embed to signal it wants to end (default: `"<<QUIT>>"`) |
| `rag_enabled` | boolean | | Enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). When `true`, the LLM retrieves context from a vector index before generating responses. Requires configuring a compatible RAG backend through `social-interaction-cloud`. |
| `index_name` | string | Required when `rag_enabled` is `true` | Name of the RAG index to query |

```json
{
  "id": "free_chat",
  "type": "llm_based",
  "prompt": "You are a friendly robot. Chat warmly with the child about their day. Ask follow-up questions. End with <<QUIT>> when the topic is exhausted.",
  "max_turns": 6,
  "speak_first": true,
  "quit_signal": "<<QUIT>>",
  "quit_phrases": ["goodbye", "stop", "done"],
  "moves": []
}
```

## Demos / Creating a Session

All you need is a minimal Python script that wires up the device, loads the dialog JSON, and runs the session. You can follow the included demos to get started quickly.

Two ready-to-run demos are included in the `examples/` directory:
* Demo 1 — General Conversation (`demo_general_conversation.py`): A simple four-step conversation using a mix of narrative and functional dialogs
* Demo 2 — Structured Conversation (`demo_structured_conversation.py`): A more complete example that demonstrates all dialog types and move types, including `ask_llm`, `play`, `motion_sequence`, and `animation`

You can find additional demos in the [SIC Applications repository](https://github.com/Social-AI-VU/sic_applications/tree/main/demos/nardial)

---

## Development

Install the dev extra to get the test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Unit tests

Run all unit tests from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Run a single file or class:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_moves.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_moves.py::TestSay
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests are opt-in and skipped by default. Pass `--integration` to enable them:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration --integration -v
```

Most integration tests only require the filesystem. The Redis tests need a running **Redis Stack** instance (plain Redis is not sufficient — Redis Stack adds the vector search module required by SIC).

The easiest way to run Redis Stack is via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -p 8001:8001 \
  -e REDIS_ARGS="--requirepass changemeplease" \
  -v redis-stack-data:/data \
  redis/redis-stack:latest
```

Then start the SIC datastore service (in a separate terminal):

```bash
run-datastore-redis
```

Then run the Redis integration tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_user_model_redis.py --integration -v
```

| Test file | Requires |
|---|---|
| `test_session_persistence.py` | Nothing (filesystem only) |
| `test_full_session.py` | Nothing (filesystem only) |
| `test_branch_session.py` | Nothing (filesystem only) |
| `test_async_events.py` | Nothing (filesystem only) |
| `test_user_model_redis.py` | Redis Stack on `127.0.0.1:6379` + `run-datastore-redis` |
| `test_llm_echo.py` | SIC LLM service |
| `test_nlu_written_keyword.py` | SIC NLU service |

### For framework developers

The sections below explain how to extend NarDialPy without breaking existing behaviour.

#### Adding a new move type

1. **`src/nardial/moves.py`** — Define a new Pydantic model that extends `Move`. Set `type: Literal["your_type"]` and declare its fields. Add the new class to the `AnyMove` discriminated union at the bottom of the file. Export the `MOVE_YOUR_TYPE` string constant.

2. **`src/nardial/authoring/schemas.py`** — If the move needs its own authoring-schema representation, add it there; otherwise the same Pydantic class serves both layers. Ensure `AnyMove` in `schemas.py` includes the new type.

3. **`src/nardial/dialog_runtime.py`** — Add an async handler method `_handle_your_type(self, move: MoveYourType, context: RunContext) -> None` to `DialogRuntime`. The dispatcher routes calls by naming convention (`_handle_<type>`) — no registration step is needed.

4. **`tests/test_moves.py`** — Add validation tests for the new Pydantic model.

5. **`tests/test_dialog_runtime.py`** (or a new file) — Add a handler test that creates a `DialogRuntime`, passes an `AsyncMockAgent` and a `RunContext`, calls `runtime.run(dialog, context)`, and asserts the expected side-effects.

#### Adding a new dialog type

1. **`src/nardial/base_dialog.py`** — Subclass `BaseDialog`. Dialog classes are **pure data containers** — they declare `dialog_id`, `dependencies`, `variable_dependencies`, `INDEX_ATTRS`, and `DEFAULT_ELIGIBILITY`, but contain no runtime logic. The base class provides `dialog_id`, `dependencies`, and `variable_dependencies` for free.

2. **`src/nardial/dialog_runtime.py`** — Add an `isinstance` branch in `DialogRuntime.run()` that delegates to a new private `_run_your_type()` async method. This is where all execution logic lives.

3. **`src/nardial/authoring/schemas.py`** — Add a new `*DialogSpec` Pydantic model and include it in the `AnyDialogSpec` discriminated union. Set a unique `type` literal that matches the JSON `"type"` field.

4. **`src/nardial/authoring/factory.py`** — Add an `isinstance` branch in `_spec_to_dialog()` (spec → runtime object) and in `_dialog_to_spec()` (runtime object → spec) for the new type.

5. **`tests/test_authoring.py`** — Add round-trip tests: construct the spec from a dict, assert the right runtime type is returned, call `to_json()` and verify the output matches the input. Add execution tests that call `DialogRuntime(...).run(dialog, context)` with an `AsyncMockAgent`.

#### Adding a new provider

1. Create a concrete class in `src/nardial/providers/<category>/your_impl.py` that implements the category's base class/protocol (e.g., `LLMProvider`, `TTSProvider`).

2. Re-export it from `src/nardial/providers/__init__.py`.

3. Inject it into `InteractionOrchestrator` via the relevant constructor argument. No other wiring is needed — dialogs talk through `ConversationAgent`, which delegates to the orchestrator.

4. Add a test in `tests/test_providers.py` that exercises the contract methods against your implementation (using mocked I/O where necessary).

#### Adding a new event source

1. Create a class in `src/nardial/events/sources/your_source.py` (or alongside its device adapter) that subclasses `EventSource` from `nardial.events.source`.

2. Implement `async def run(self, bus: EventBus) -> None`. This method must not swallow `CancelledError` — re-raise it after any cleanup so `SessionManager` can shut down cleanly.

3. Emit events via `await bus.emit(event)` for asyncio-safe callers, or `bus.emit_sync(event)` from non-async callbacks (e.g., SIC framework device callbacks running on a Redis thread).

4. Register the source with `manager.add_event_source(your_source)` or declare it in a `SessionPlan`'s `event_sources` list (supported types: `"timer"`, `"webhook"`).

5. Add tests in `tests/test_your_source.py` following the pattern in `tests/test_device_sources.py` — create an `EventBus`, run the source as an `asyncio.Task`, fire callbacks or wait for timers, then assert the emitted events.
